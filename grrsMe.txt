Pikachu is yellow,
Squirtle is blue,
I love Pokémon,
And so do you.

Pokémon are great,
Pokémon are fun,
Catch them all,
Until the day is done.

Battle in the morning,
Battle in the night,
Battle when it's wrong,
Battle when it's right.

Battle in the grass,
Battle in the cave,
Battle in the rain,
Battle with a wave.

Battle with a smile,
Battle with a frown,
Battle when you're up,
Battle when you're down.

Battle with a Charmander,
Battle with a Bulbasaur,
Battle with a Pidgey,
Battle with a roar.

Battle in the east,
Battle in the west,
Pokémon is the game,
That we love best.
